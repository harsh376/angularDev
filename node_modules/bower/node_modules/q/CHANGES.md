## 1.4.1

 - Address an issue that prevented Q from being used as a `<script>` for
   Firefox add-ons. Q can now be used in any environment that provides `window`
   or `self` globals, favoring `window` since add-ons have an an immutable
   `self` that is distinct from `window`.

## 1.4.0

 - Add `noConflict` support for use in `<script>` (@jahnjw).

## 1.3.0

 - Add tracking for unhandled and handled rejections in Node.js (@benjamingr).

## 1.2.1

 - Fix Node.js environment detection for modern Browserify (@kahnjw).

## 1.2.0

 - Added Q.any(promisesArray) method (@vergara).
   Returns a promise fulfilled with the value of the first resolved promise in
   promisesArray. If all promises in promisesArray are rejected, it returns
   a rejected promise.

## 1.1.2

 - Removed extraneous files from the npm package by using the "files"
   whitelist in package.json instead of the .npmignore blacklist.

## 1.1.1

 - Fix a pair of regressions in bootstrapping, one which precluded
   WebWorker support, and another that precluded support in
   ``<script>`` usage outright. #607

## 1.1.0

 - Adds support for enabling long stack traces in node.js by setting
   environment variable `Q_DEBUG=1`.
 - Introduces the `tap` method to promises, which will see a value
   pass through without alteration.
 - Use instanceof to recognize own promise instances as opposed to
   thenables.
 - Construct timeout errors with `code === ETIMEDOUT` (Kornel Lesi≈Ñski)
 - More descriminant CommonJS module environment detection.
 - Dropped continuous integration for Node.js 0.6 and 0.8 because of
   changes to npm that preclude the use of new `^` version predicate
   operator in any transitive dependency.
 - Users can now override `Q.nextTick`.

## 1.0.1

 - Adds support for `Q.Promise`, which implements common usage of the
   ES6 `Promise` constructor and its methods. `Promise` does not have
   a valid promise constructor and a proper implementation awaits
   version 2 of Q.
 - Removes the console stopgap for a promise inspector. This no longer
   works with any degree of reliability.
 - Fixes support for content security policies that forbid eval. Now
   using the `StopIteration` global to distinguish SpiderMonkey
   generators from ES6 generators, assuming that they will never
   coexist.

## 1.0.0

:cake: This is all but a re-release of version 0.9, which has settled
into a gentle maintenance mode and rightly deserves an official 1.0.
An ambitious 2.0 release is already around the corner, but 0.9/1.0
have been distributed far and wide and demand long term support.

 - Q will now attempt to post a debug message in browsers regardless
   of whether window.Touch is defined. Chrome at least now has this
   property regardless of whether touch is supported by the underlying
   hardware.
 - Remove deprecation warning from `promise.valueOf`. The function is
   called by the browser in various ways so there is no way to
   distinguish usage that should be migrated from usage that cannot be
   altered.

## 0.9.7

 - :warning: `q.min.js` is no longer checked-in.  It is however still
   created by Grunt and NPM.
 - Fixes a bug that inhibited `Q.async` with implementations of the new
   ES6 generators.
 - Fixes a bug with `nextTick` affecting Safari 6.0.5 the first time a
   page loads when an `iframe` is involved.
 - Introduces `passByCopy`, `join`, and `race`.
 - Shows stack traces or error messages on the console, instead of
   `Error` objects.
 - Elimintates wrapper methods for improved performance.
 - `Q.all` now propagates progress notifications of the form you might
   expect of ES6 iterations, `{value, index}` where the `value` is the
   progress notification from the promise at `index`.

## 0.9.6

 - Fixes a bug in recognizing the difference between compatible Q
   promises, and Q promises from before the implementation of "inspect".
   The latter are now coerced.
 - Fixes an infinite asynchronous coercion cycle introduced by former
   solution, in two independently sufficient ways.  1.) All promises
   returned by makePromise now implement "inspect", albeit a default
   that reports that the promise has an "unknown" state.  2.) The
   implementation of "then/when" is now in "then" instead of "when", so
   that the responsibility to "coerce" the given promise rests solely in
   the "when" method and the "then" method may assume that "this" is a
   promise of the right type.
 - Refactors `nextTick` to use an unrolled microtask within Q regardless
   of how new ticks a requested. #316 @rkatic

## 0.9.5

 - Introduces `inspect` for getting the state of a promise as
   `{state: "fulfilled" | "rejected" | "pending", value | reason}`.
 - Introduces `allSettled` which produces an array of promises states
   for the input promises once they have all "settled".  This is in
   accordance with a discussion on Promises/A+ that "settled" refers to
   a promise that is "fulfilled" or "rejected".  "resolved" refers to a
   deferred promise that has been "resolved" to another promise,
   "sealing its fate" to the fate of the successor promise.
 - Long stack traces are now off by default.  Set `Q.longStackSupport`
   to true to enable long stack traces.
 - Long stack traces can now follow the entire asynchronous history of a
   promise, not just a single jump.
 - Introduces `spawn` for an immediately invoked asychronous generator.
   @jlongster
 - Support for *experimental* synonyms `mapply`, `mcall`, `nmapply`,
   `nmcall` for method invocation.

## 0.9.4

 - `isPromise` and `isPromiseAlike` now always returns a boolean
   (even for falsy values). #284 @lfa
